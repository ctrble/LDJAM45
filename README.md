## Enemies

1. Eel - Moves along the ceiling, slowly stalking you before grappling and quickly biting.
2. Shark - Charges you, head snapping back and forth while scratching with ragged claws.
3. Octopus - Grabs you with tentacles, whipping you about before drawing you in and chomping hard.
4. Mimic Pufferfish - Hides in plain site, then suddenly bursting as you pass by.
5. Angler - Startles and distracts you to create an opening, snapping at you.

Flash and freeze frame on hit, shake screen, really make the hit be felt.
