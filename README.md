## Inventory

Any item can be used as a melee weapon as a secondary action. Some items, like guns, are very loud and can either draw in or scare away enemies. Other items, like the flamethrower and flashlight, illuminate an area and can attract or repel different enemies.

1. Pistol - Shoot bullets, quickly and with high range, but low damage.
2. Shotgun - Shoot shells, high damage spread burst, but low range and slow loading.
3. AK - Shoot bullets, moderate rapid damage.
4. Flamethrower - Shoot flame with fuel, high and continuous damage, but low range.
5. Harpoon - Fire a sharp hook, doing some damage and firmly tethering to whatever it hits.
6. Dynamite - Thrown explosive, mid range and high area damage.
7. Pipe Wrench - Force open (or closed) hatches and latches.
8. Flashlight - Shine light wherever you point.
9. Handheld Sonar - Detect objects that aren't necessarily visible, even showing moving objects.
10. Underwater Suit (not stored in inventory) - Don the suit to enter the depths outside the station without suffocating or being crushed by the water, movement is slowed considerably, but it's bulk provides armor. The suit may even be useful as a source of filtered air in the event of a contamination...

## Enemies

1. Eel - Moves along the ceiling, slowly stalking you before grappling and quickly biting.
2. Shark - Charges you, head snapping back and forth while scratching with ragged claws.
3. Octopus - Grabs you with tentacles, whipping you about before drawing you in and chomping hard.
4. Mimic Pufferfish - Hides in plain site, then suddenly bursting as you pass by. If in water, look for telltale ripples.
5. Angler - Startles and distracts you to create an opening, snapping at you.
6.
7.

Flash and freeze frame on hit, shake screen, really make the hit be felt.

## Mystery and puzzle solving

Underwater sections, hold your breath and find your way through.

Computer systems, break into them and control parts of the station.

### Underwater Habitats

```
   - –– -

```

### Crush Depth

starts with leaks, then crumples like a tin can

### Airlocks

floodable or underwater airlocks

a great way to off an enemy

### Reactor Accidents

"loss of coolant"

### Sonar

ping and pulse, can vary the power and angles of detection (broad, nearby, rough information vs targeted, distant, and accurate information)

measure the time to reach an object and reflect back to the listener

signal processing helps to differentiate signal vs noise, can be a manual or automatic task

some creatures flee sonar, others use it to locate predators and prey

```
       power amplifier: +/- strength
       |
       |
_______|______beamformer: +/- angle
       |
       |
       |
```

### Mines

explode on contact (hedgehog) vs explode at depth (depth charge)

### Torpedos

there's a dead moment after firing, as the torpedo travels, when the attacker is unware of what their target is doing, perhaps dodging away with a sharp turn



# Notes on Doom

distinct
consistent
discernable

"orthogonal unit differentiation"
unique attributes instead of varying the same couple values
about 7 total enemy types, easy to learn (think of working memory)
each has a "tell"

```

_______|______speed
       |

```

weak enemy with hitscan
slower moving enemies with higher damage but slower projectile attacks
melee enemy that charges towards the player
slower melee enemy that does high damage
etc
